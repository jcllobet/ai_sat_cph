This Repo belongs to the Machine Learning Course organized by __Saturdays.AI Copenhagen__.

The course is structured in two parts:

## 1. Code2Learn
  The first part consists of 6 weeks where we cover (what we consider) the basics of Machine Learning:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis, Biases
  - Supervised Learning: Classification
  - Supervised Learning: Regression
  - Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
  - Neural Networks
  - Time Series for Machine Learning

## 2. Build2Learn
  The second part consists of 5 weeks where we develop projects related to the topics covered, with a focus on contributing to the _Sustainable Development Goals_. 
  
  The students work in groups of 2-5 and find the solution to a social impact problem with support of our Mentors.
  
## Important information
We are a Copenhagen-based (DK) branch of __Saturdays.AI__, a non-profit that aims to democratize people's access to Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Feel free to take a sneak peak at our notebooks and try completing the Challenges! We have put together the material, sometimes from scratch, sometimes from other Saturdays.AI editions and sometimes based on well known open machine learning courses.

As a side note, we are always open for new material to improve the educational quality of our courses, so feel free to reach out through Social Media at one of our profiles - we are on _LinkedIn_, _Twitter_, _Facebook_, _Instagram_ and try to be active on _Meetup_.
