This Repo belongs to the Machine Learning Course organized by __Saturdays.AI Copenhagen__.

The course is structured in two parts:

## 1. Code2Learn
  The first part consists of 6 weeks where we cover (what we consider) the basics of Machine Learning:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis, Biases
  - Supervised Learning: Classification
  - Supervised Learning: Regression
  - Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
  - Neural Networks
  - Time Series for Machine Learning

## 2. Build2Learn
  The second part consists of 5 weeks where we develop projects related to the topics covered, with a focus on contributing to the _Sustainable Development Goals_. 
  
  The students work in groups of 3-5 and find the solution to a social impact problem with support of our Mentors.
  
## Important information
We are a Copenhagen-based (DK) branch of __Saturdays.AI__, a non-profit that aims to democratize people's access to Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Feel free to take a sneak peak at our notebooks and try completing the Challenges! We have put together the material, sometimes from scratch and sometimes based on well known open machine learning courses.

As a side note, are always open for new material to improve the educational quality of our courses, so feel free to reach out through Social Media at one of our profiles - we are on _LinkedIn_, _Twitter_, _Facebook_, _Instagram_ and try to be active on _Meetup_.
